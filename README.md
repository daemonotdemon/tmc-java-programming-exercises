# My solutions to the exercises of the Java Programming Course of MOOC from the University of Helsinki

Currently I'm learning Java after years being out of touch with the programming world. I got recommended the MOOC course and decided to give it a try.
It turns out the course is great and I'm learning very fast.

I created this repository to archive my own solutions to the programming exercises, with all the mistakes and lack of elegance (and most of the time commentary), but I'm learning after all.
Hope this helps anyone who comes across it to have their own ideas and experiment with the exercises from the course.
